    <string name="step1">
        <b>Prepare ingredients</b>\nWash the beef, slice the beef into small pieces (your personal choice, we prefer small pieces
        since it is easy to eat and it is not going to be chewy), also slice the onion, tomatoes,
        as well as mince the shallots and garlics.
